/*
 How It Works:
When users navigate to /, the Home page is displayed.

When they visit /products, the Product Listing page is shown.

If they click on a product and are taken to /products/:id, the Product Details page appears with dynamic product information.

The Cart page is displayed when they navigate to /cart.
